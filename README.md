# Visitor Entry Monitoring System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Visitor Entry Monitoring System for M Kumarasmay College of Engineering! This innovative project aims to streamline and enhance the visitor entry process on our campus. With real-time notifications and approval workflows, we ensure a secure and efficient way to monitor and manage visitor access.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Notifications

When a visitor arrives on campus, an instant notification is sent to the person they intend to visit. This feature ensures timely communication and enhances the overall visitor experience.

### 2. Approval Workflow

Visitors can only exit the campus after receiving approval from the person they are here to visit. This additional layer of security ensures that visitors leave the premises with proper authorization.

### 3. Visitor Entry Tracking

The system maintains a comprehensive log of visitor entries, organized by date and time. This log provides valuable insights into the number of visitors on campus on any given day.

## Usage

1. **Visitors:**
   - Upon arrival, provide necessary details at the entry point.
   - Await approval from the host to exit the campus.

2. **Hosts:**
   - Receive real-time notifications about incoming visitors.
   - Approve or deny visitor exit requests promptly.

Happy monitoring!
